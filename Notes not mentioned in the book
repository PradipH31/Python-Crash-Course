print(abc, def)
print can take multiple arguments like string abc int def

Dictionary can be created with dict() function
    It initializes a new dictionary with the name=value pairs
    For example:  dict(one=1, two=2)
    For example:  a = dict(one=1, two=2)

Before importing a module, make sure that the module contains only functions.
Or else, every code will be executed while importing.
It should not contain even the execution of the function

Classes:
Any function of a class will provide self as an argument to the method
So all functions of a class must have a self parameter

Classes should start with capital letters to avoid problems while importing
functions and classes

Using format with print:
a = "Pradip"
print('{} is gamer').format(a)

For the run extension, the shebang requires complete path,
not the relative path

To remove new line, use strip(l/r/a)

Store absolute paths in a variable
File writer will only write string data

File writer will not create a new file.
It requires existing file
json.dump() does not require nuw file

String.count('text') method returns the number of occurence of 'text' in the
string. It is helpful to use string.lower().count('text')

A unit test verifies that one specific aspect of a function’s behavior is correct.
A test case is a collection of unit tests that together prove
that a function behaves as it’s supposed to, within the full range of situations 
you expect it to handle.

In plotting lines,
c=(x,y,z) to set different colors ranging from 0-1
Value closer to 1 produce light colors
Value closer to 0 produce dark colors

In matplotlib, pyplot:
pyplot.plot(x, y, c='',alpha=integer)
Here, alpha=ranges from 0 to 1
denoting transparency
