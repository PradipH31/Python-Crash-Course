Dictionary can be created with dict() function
    It initializes a new dictionary with the name=value pairs
    For example:  dict(one=1, two=2)
    For example:  a = dict(one=1, two=2)

Before importing a module, make sure that the module contains only functions.
Or else, every code will be executed while importing.
It should not contain even the execution of the function

Classes:
Any function of a class will provide self as an argument to the method
So all functions of a class must have a self parameter

Classes should start with capital letters to avoid problems while importing
